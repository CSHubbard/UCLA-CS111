FILES INCLUDED (4):
(1) - README 
(2) - lab0.c
	The C source module for prject 0. It implements a simple input/output redirectuion program.
	It also contains the functionality to force itself to create a segmentation fault using the
	--segfault arguement as well as catch this segfault if used alongside the --catch option.
(3) - Makefile
	A simple makefile that builds, tars, and smoke-tests the C program
(4) - backtrace.png
	An image showing the forced segfault as well as a backtrace to the exact line which causes it.
(5) - breakpoint.png
	An image showing breakpoint use as wella s inspection of the nullpointer variable.

	
PERSONAL SMOKE TEST:
	The personal smoke test in my Makefile has 4 test cases as follows
	#test input redirection argument - tests that input redirection works correctly
	#test output redirection argument - tests that output redirection works correctly
	#test catch argument - test that the catch argument is workign correctly
	#test segmentation fault argument - tests that the segmentation fault argument works correctly

NOTES:
You should know that I have run into difficulty with the segfault and catch smoke tests as they 
 seem to exit the Makefile as soon as they run lab0 with ther respective arguments.
	
All code in my Project follows almost directly from the examples and explanations
 provided in my TA section. Wih this in mind my program my be somewhat similar to any others who 
 relied on the Ta's instructions as much as I did.
 
The code for input and output redirection is almost identical to that of the example 
provided in the project spec.
