FILES INCLUDED (4):
(1) - README 
(2) - lab1a.c
	The C source module for prject 1a. It implements a simple Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O.
	With the --shell command the program implements passing of input and output between two processes, the shell and the
	previously described Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal.	
(3) - Makefile
	A simple makefile that builds, cleans, and tars.

NOTES:
The code for my Character-at-a-time mode is taken directly from the 
GNU C Library's "17.7 Noncanonical Mode Example"
	
Some code in my Project follows almost directly from the examples and explanations
 provided in my TA section. Wih this in mind my program my be somewhat similar to any others who 
 relied on the TA's instructions as much as I did.
